Add a transistor for IR output to increase power from 20ma up...
  A resistor may also be needed
6/5/2013 started testing, seems ok.
6/25/2013 Change D18 to D17 for nRF24L01...Add NPN Transistor for D3 IR output
          Removed extra h-bridge 4pin connector
          IR transmitter
             - Connects to pin that was previously connected to D3...Now transistor
             + Connects to VCC (5V) straight....Is a resistor required?  who knows
